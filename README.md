# Linear Equation Solver using Echelon Form

This program solves a system of linear equations using the echelon form approach. It determines whether the system has no solution, a unique solution, or multiple solutions. The program uses matrix row operations to reduce the system to echelon form and then applies back-substitution to find the solutions.

## Features
- Converts the given system of equations into echelon form.
- Detects whether the system has:
  - **No solution** (inconsistent system)
  - **A unique solution**
  - **Multiple solutions** (dependent system)
- Computes the solution if it is unique.

## How to Use
### **Input Format**
- The first line contains two integers: `n` (number of variables) and `eq` (number of equations).
- The next `eq` lines contain `n+1` integers, where the first `n` values are the coefficients of the variables, and the last value is the constant term.

### **Example Input**
```
3 3
2 1 -1 8
-3 -1 2 -11
-2 1 2 -3
```
This represents the following system of equations:
```
2x +  y -  z =  8
-3x - y + 2z = -11
-2x + y + 2z = -3
```

### **Example Output**
```
Reduce to echelon form:
2 1 -1 = 8
0 -0.5 0.5 = 1
0 0 1 = 2
Unique solution
x1 = 2
x2 = 3
x3 = 4
```
